### ❌ NOT VISIBLE on https://shittycodingagent.ai/packages
- Searched for "a2a" - no results
- Scrolled through package list - not found
- Package does not appear in gallery

---

## Why It's Not Visible

The pi.dev/packages gallery **does not automatically** index all npm packages with the `pi-package` keyword. Based on the documentation:

1. **Gallery is curated** - Packages are manually added or indexed through a specific process
2. **Submission required** - Package maintainers need to submit their packages
3. **No automatic discovery** - Having the `pi-package` keyword alone is not enough

---

## How to Get Listed

### Option 1: Manual Submission (Recommended)
Contact pi maintainers via:
- **GitHub Issues:** https://github.com/mariozechner/pi/issues
- **Discord:** Link on pi.dev website
- **Direct contact:** mariozechner (package maintainer)

### Option 2: Wait for Indexing
The gallery may periodically scan npm for new packages, but this is not guaranteed and timing is unknown.

### Option 3: Community PR
Submit a PR to the pi repository adding the package to the gallery index (if the gallery is open-source).

## Next Steps for Gallery Inclusion

1. **Contact pi maintainer** (Mario Zechner) via GitHub or Discord
2. **Reference this package:** `npm:pi-a2a-communication`
3. **Share documentation:** gallery-submission.md
4. **Request addition** to shittycodingagent.ai/packages
